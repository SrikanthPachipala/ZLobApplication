# ZLobApplication
This is a Java-based web application built using Spring MVC, Hibernate, and MySQL, designed to manage and store Large Objects (LOBs) such as text, images, and videos in the database. The application follows a clean architecture with Controller-Service-DAO layers, and uses Java-based configuration instead of java based.
